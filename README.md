# HX711 for Raspbery Pi

HX711 library fork with minor updates to support a school project.

Updates example_hx711v0_5_1.py to filter random values seen during testing, and update RPI's GPIO 17 HIGH or LOW based on pressure sensed.

## Instructions
```bash
clone git@github.com:ezracarab01/hx711py.git
python example_hx711v0_5_1.py --polling-based
```

Credits to underdoeg for the library's original implementation and to tatobari for the improvements.
